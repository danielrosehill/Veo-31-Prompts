The video begins with what appears to be the door to a synagogue with the Star of David on it. The doors open.

We see a cute looking sloth wearing a skullcap and a suit. It appears as if the sloth is a rabbi! There is an empty coffee cup next to the sloth.  There is an open text with Hebrew writing in front of the sloth.

The sloth says:

"Good morning, gentlemen! Today's daf is Zevachim 37 amud aleph. Today's daf discusses more details of the sacrificial offerings at the beit hamikdash"

The camera then dollies back slightly so that we can see the other side of the table. There are two men there who are sleepingon their texts.
